# Jonah Heim — Brand & Marketing Strategy

## The Problem with Your Current Positioning

Your website currently says **"Architect of Leverage"** with roles: *Systems Builder · Product Engineer · Growth Strategist.* The language is sharp and the design is premium — but the actual signal is narrow. Everything funnels toward "I build websites and apps for small businesses." That's not wrong, but it boxes you in.

You want the aura of someone who:

- Could build anything (jack of all trades)
- Has mastered AI as a tool and a thinking framework
- Ships faster and thinks deeper
- Carries wisdom — not just technical knowledge
- Is dangerous in the best sense: underestimated, then undeniable

---

## Part 1: The Aura — Who You Actually Are



It's a good line, but it sounds borrowed. It signals "I read Naval Ravikant" more than "I am this person." You need language that feels *native* — like you couldn't have gotten it from anyone else.

### New Identity Framework

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| Leverage Builder
| Systems Builder · Product Engineer · Growth Strategist |
| "Code and capital are permissionless leverage" |

### Your Archetype: **The Polymath Operator**

Not a developer. Not a designer. Not a strategist. You are someone who *combines all three* and adds AI fluency on top. The brand is:

> **"I learn fast, build fast, and think in systems 

### Core Brand Pillars

1. **AI-Native** — You don't just *use* AI. You think with it. You build with it. You have opinions about where it's going.
2. **Full-Stack Life** — Code, business, design, strategy, writing, investing. You don't apologize for being broad — breadth IS your edge.
3. **Old Soul, Young Energy** — You read. You think. You have frameworks. But you also ship at 2AM and learn new stacks in a weekend.
4. **Proof Over Promise** — Everything links back to things you've actually built, launched, or published.

## Part 2: Social Media Strategy

### Platform Priority

| Platform | Role | Post Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **X (Twitter)** | Primary thought leadership + build-in-public | 1-2x daily |
| **LinkedIn** | Professional credibility + longer-form wins | 3-4x per week |
| **YouTube** | Deep dives, tutorials, build videos | 1x per week (start biweekly) |
| **Instagram** | Lifestyle + visual brand extension | 3-4x per week (stories daily) |

---

### X (Twitter) Strategy

**Goal:** Be known as the young builder who ships fast, thinks deep, and has AI literacy that makes senior engineers uncomfortable.

#### Content Types (rotate through these):

**1. Build logs (40%)**
- Short threads showing what you built today
- Screenshots, code snippets, before/afters
- *"Just automated a landscaping quoting system with satellite imagery and ML. Took a weekend. The owner used to spend 3 hours per quote."*

**2. Sharp takes (25%)**
- Hot takes on AI, tech, business, learning
- Keep them punchy — 1-3 sentences max
- *"Most developers are afraid of AI taking their job. I'm more afraid of developers who don't learn to use it."*
- *"The best product managers I know don't call themselves product managers."*

**3. Wisdom drops (20%)**
- Insights that make people pause — things that sound like they came from someone 15 years older
- *"The fastest way to learn isn't courses. It's having something on the line — a client, a deadline, a reputation."*
- *"Everyone wants to 'add value.' The real question is: can you capture it?"*

**4. Curated signal (15%)**
- Share interesting articles/papers/tools with your analysis
- Shows you're plugged in and thinking about the frontier
- *"Been reading about [X]. Here's what most people miss about it..."*

#### Engagement Rules
- Reply to big accounts in your space with *substantive* takes (not "great post!")
- Quote-tweet with your own experience and perspective
- DM people you admire with specific, useful observations — not asks

---

### LinkedIn Strategy

**Goal:** Position yourself as someone companies should hire for high-leverage work, not hourly grunt work. LinkedIn is your credibility engine.

#### Content Types:

**1. Case studies / project breakdowns (40%)**
- Turn each project into a story: Problem → Approach → Result
- *"A landscaping company was spending 3 hours per quote. I built an AI tool that cut it to 5 minutes. Here's how..."*

**2. Frameworks & mental models (30%)**
- Package your thinking into reusable frameworks
- *"3 questions I ask before building anything for a client..."*
- *"Why I think about every project through the lens of leverage..."*

**3. Personal journey + milestones (20%)**
- Your age is an asset here — lean into it
- *"I'm [age]. I've shipped 4 products, built websites for 3 businesses, and taught myself Python, ML, and product design. Here's what I've learned..."*

**4. Industry commentary (10%)**
- Thoughtful takes on AI in business, no-code vs. code, the future of work
- Position yourself as someone thinking ahead of the curve

#### Profile Optimization
- **Headline:** `Builder & AI Operator | I ship products, automate businesses, and think in systems`
- **About:** Lead with proof, not promises. List what you've built. End with what you're looking for.
- **Banner:** Dark, minimal, your name + "Builder. Thinker. Operator."

---

### YouTube Strategy

**Goal:** Long-form proof of competence. Nothing says "this person is legit" like watching them think and build on camera.

#### Content Pillars:

1. **"Build With Me" series** — Real-time project builds, sped up with voiceover explaining decisions
2. **"AI Breakdown" series** — Take a new AI tool/concept and show how you'd actually use it in a real project
3. **"How I'd Fix This" series** — Take a bad website/app and redesign + rebuild it from scratch live
4. **Knowledge drops** — 5-10 minute videos on topics like: *"Why I Learn Everything Instead of Specializing"* or *"What I Learned Building 4 Products Before Turning [age]"*

#### Production Notes
- You don't need fancy editing. Clean screenshare + facecam + clear audio.
- Thumbnails: Bold text, your face, dark background. Consistent style.
- Titles: Curiosity-driven, specific. Not clickbait, but compelling.

---

### Instagram Strategy

**Goal:** Humanize the brand. Show the lifestyle behind the work — your workspace, your reading, your process.

#### Content Types:

- **Stories (daily):** Quick clips of work setup, code on screen, books you're reading, AI tools you're testing
- **Reels (2-3x/week):** 30-60 second clips: fast-paced build timelapses, hot takes to camera, "day in the life"
- **Carousel posts (1-2x/week):** Visual breakdowns of concepts, "5 things I learned this week," project spotlights

#### Aesthetic
- Dark mode. Clean. Moody lighting. Minimal text overlays.
- Consistent color palette matching your website (deep blues, warm accents)
- Professional but not corporate — approachable intensity

---

## Part 3: Website Strategy

Your website is already well-designed. The issue isn't aesthetics — it's **positioning and depth**.

### Changes to Make

#### 1. Rewrite the Hero Section

**Current:**
> *Systems Builder · Product Engineer · Growth Strategist*
> *Code and capital are permissionless leverage...*

**Proposed:**
> **Builder. Thinker. Operator.**
> *I build products, automate businesses, and solve problems across domains — powered by AI, driven by curiosity, and measured by results.*

The hero proof chips should change from:
- ~~Python + Product Logic~~ → **AI-Native Builder**
- ~~Macroeconomic Thinking~~ → **Cross-Domain Thinker**
- ~~Builder-Operator Mindset~~ → **Ships Fast, Thinks Deep**

#### 2. Add "What I Actually Do" Section (between Hero and Apps)

Create a new section that communicates your *range*. Something like:

> **I don't fit in one box — and that's the point.**
>
> - 🧠 **AI & Automation** — Building intelligent tools that replace manual work
> - 🎨 **Design & Branding** — Full visual identity systems for businesses
> - 💻 **Full-Stack Engineering** — Web apps, APIs, data pipelines
> - 📈 **Business Strategy** — Positioning, growth systems, operations
> - ✍️ **Writing & Thinking** — Ideas that compound

#### 3. Add a "Currently Learning / Exploring" Strip

A subtle, animated ticker or small section showing what you're currently diving into. This signals curiosity and growth.

*Examples:* `Currently exploring: Transformer architectures · Behavioral economics · Rust · Startup GTM strategy`

#### 4. Expand the Skills Cloud

Your current skills are too narrow for the brand you want. Add:

| Add | Remove |
|---|---|
| Machine Learning | *(keep all current)* |
| LLMs / Prompt Engineering | |
| Data Analysis | |
| Business Strategy | |
| Product Design | |
| Copywriting | |
| Automation | |

#### 5. Add a "Reading" or "Influences" Section

Nothing says "wisdom beyond your years" like showing what you're reading. A small section with 3-5 books you're currently into or that shaped your thinking.

- Shows depth
- Creates conversation starters
- Separates you from "I watch tutorials" developers

#### 6. Upgrade the Writing Section

Your essays are strong — but lean harder into the **range** of topics. Consider adding categories like:
- **AI & Technology** — Where things are going
- **Business & Strategy** — How to think about value
- **Personal Operating System** — How you learn, build, and decide

---

## Part 4: The Tone — How You Sound

### Voice Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| Short, confident sentences | Long, academic paragraphs |
| State opinions without hedging | "I think maybe..." or "In my opinion..." |
| Use concrete examples and proof | Make vague claims |
| Show your thinking process | Just share conclusions |
| Reference books, thinkers, mental models | Sound like you only know tech Twitter |
| Acknowledge what you don't know yet | Pretend to be an expert in everything |

### The "Old Soul" Voice

To sound wise without sounding pretentious:

- **Use analogies from non-tech domains** — history, nature, sports, economics
- **Cite books and thinkers** — not just tech bros, but philosophers, economists, strategists
- **Share lessons from failure** — nothing ages you up like earned humility
- **Write declaratively** — "This is true" hits different than "I believe this might be true"

### Sample Voice Calibration

> ❌ *"I'm a passionate developer who loves building things and am always eager to learn new technologies!"*

> ✅ *"I build things. I learn whatever the problem demands. Last month it was satellite imagery and ML for quoting landscaping jobs. This month it's transformer architectures. The constant is: I figure it out, and I ship."*

## The Bottom Line

You're not trying to be a "jack of all trades" in the negative sense. You're a **polymath operator** — someone who sees connections others miss *because* you work across domains. The people who change industries aren't specialists. They're the ones who bring ideas from one world into another.

Your age works for you, not against you. When people find out how young you are *after* seeing what you've built, that's the most powerful marketing there is.

> **The brand isn't "I can do everything."
> The brand is "I figure out whatever needs to be figured out — and then I build it."**
