            <h1>Specific Knowledge at the Intersection</h1>
            <div class="essay-meta">February 2026</div>

            <p class="essay-lede">Specific knowledge is not a checklist skill. It's pattern recognition developed
                through direct exposure to constraints, customers, and consequences.</p>

            <h2>The Intersection Is the Edge</h2>
            <p>My edge is not just design, nor just engineering. It's the intersection where software decisions and
                business decisions collide. At that edge, small technical improvements can create major commercial
                effects.</p>
            <p>A local business website is not just a visual artifact. It's a conversion system with inputs, friction
                points, and revenue implications. A quoting workflow is not just a form. It is a model for time, trust,
                and margin.</p>

            <h2>How This Becomes Valuable</h2>
            <p>Value appears when you reduce ambiguity. Define the core variable, simplify the user path, instrument
                what matters, and ship rapidly enough to learn. This loop is where specific knowledge compounds.</p>

            <div class="essay-quote">Specific knowledge is built in the field, not inherited from a syllabus.</div>

            <h2>What Businesses Actually Need</h2>
            <p>Most businesses don't need more tools. They need coherent systems. They need someone who can align brand,
                user flow, and operational logic into one machine.</p>
            <p>Intersectional skill is rare because it demands two opposing talents: a taste for creative chaos and a
                discipline for hard data.</p>
