            <h1>Designing for Trust in Service Businesses</h1>
            <div class="essay-meta">January 2026</div>

            <p class="essay-lede">For service businesses, design quality is not cosmetic. It is often the first proof
                that the business is organized, credible, and worth contacting.</p>

            <h2>Trust Is a Sequence</h2>
            <p>Trust is built through sequence: clear positioning, visible proof, low-friction steps. If any part is
                weak, conversion collapses. This is why many local business sites underperform despite solid services.
            </p>
            <p>Users are not evaluating artistic originality. They are asking practical questions quickly. Can I trust
                this team? Do they do what I need? How do I contact them right now?</p>

            <h2>Design Decisions That Matter</h2>
            <p>Hierarchy, spacing, typography, and copy clarity all affect credibility. Strong visual rhythm
                communicates competence. Specific language reduces ambiguity. Concrete calls to action remove
                hesitation.</p>

            <div class="essay-quote">A good business website should feel like a reliable operator, not a design
                experiment.</div>

            <h2>From Aesthetic to Outcome</h2>
            <p>The goal is not a prettier homepage. The goal is a tighter decision path from first visit to qualified
                inquiry. When design aligns with business logic, trust becomes measurable.</p>
